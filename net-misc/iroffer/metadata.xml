		iroffer is a software program that acts as a fileserver for IRC. It is similar to a FTP server or WEB server, but users can download files using the DCC protocol of IRC instead of a web browser.
		
		Unlike similar programs, iroffer is not a script, it is a standalone executable written entirely in c from scratch with high transfer speed and effeciency in mind.
		iroffer has been found to transfer over 50MByte/sec over a gigabit ethernet connection.
