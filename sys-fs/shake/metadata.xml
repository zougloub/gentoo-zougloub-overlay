		Shake is a defragmenter that runs in userspace, without the need of patching the kernel and while the system is in use (for now, on GNU/Linux only).
		Contrary to xfs_fsr, it use only fonctions commons to all filesystems. More than a port, it tries to add new ideas, mainly the one of a selective defragmentation, that is to defragment only the few files that it's usefull to.
